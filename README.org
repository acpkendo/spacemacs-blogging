* Description

This is a simple layer I created to install blogging-related packages.

* Install

You'll need to install the [[https://gohugo.io/][Hugo static site generator]]. Your Linux distribution probably has one of these, which you can install in the normal way (e.g. in Ubuntu):

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ sudo apt install hugo
#+END_SRC

Then, add ~blogging~ to your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need to add =blogging= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in this file.


* Key bindings

No additional keybindings outside of what the packages themselves provide.
